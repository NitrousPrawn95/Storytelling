                The Manhattan Project is officially created on August 13, 1942. Shortly, a few years later, Theoretical physicist J. Robert Openheimer and his team conducted the first ever detonation of a nuclear device 210 miles south of Los Alamos, NM.

The nuclear device detonated at Trinity, nicknamed “Gadget,” was shaped like a large steel globe. Like the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, it was a plutonium implosion device. Plutonium implosion devices are more efficient and powerful than gun-type uranium bombs like the Little Boy bomb detonated over Hiroshima.      </div>

                Not long after, the Manhattan project saw it's end by harnessing the power of the atom for warfare. Two powerful nuclear warheads, "Little Boy" and "Fat Man", were created in an attempt to end the war in the pacific threatre. Shortly after its addition in the Air force's arsenal, President Truman ordered an attack on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. </p>
 <p class="heading">
                 When Japan did not surrender at this attack, Truman ordered another bombing run in the densely populated city of Nagasaki. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki </p>

          The atomic bomb used at Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, was "Little Boy".  The bomb was dropped by a USAAF B-29 bomber, "Enola Gay", and weighed 9,000 pounds with a diameter of only 28 inches.  The gun-type weapon possessed the power of 26,000,000 pounds of high explosives.

      <div class="box imgtxt">
Released by the B-29 Bockscar, and nicknamed by the crew as the "Fat Man", the 10,000-pound weapon was detonated at an altitude of approximately 1,800 feet over the city. The bomb had an explosive force (yield) of about 20,000 tons of TNT, about the same as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Because of Nagasaki's hilly terrain, however, the damage was somewhat less extensive than of the relatively flat Hiroshima.<p> Nuclear fission for both "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" was achieved by the collision of two parts of active Uranium-235 material. The U-235 projectile is fired down a gun barrel colliding with a stationary element, in this case the ground, causing a mass increase leading to nuclear fission, seen as its bright initial flash.</p>
